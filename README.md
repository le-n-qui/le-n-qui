Hello there! I am a Data Science graduate student who takes computational linguistics classes. 
My courses are at the intersection of computation, probability and linguistics. 
From my courses, I am learning many useful programming skills, such as Python 
(text processing, data preparation and machine learning methods), Java 
(Object-Oriented Design), and R (Linear/Logistic Regression, ANOVA 
and hypothesis testing). I am planning to increase my exposure to Data Science
and High Performance Computing. One relevant experience that I had was from Google
Career Readiness Program in Summer 2021 where I learned about Google Cloud Platform
and SQL for processing large amounts of data.
